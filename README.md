# mix-a-mood

A light-hearted web app to bring a smile to your day.

A personal sofware engineering project completed in the final weeks of the Makers Academy course, using Node.js and Express. Also using some product design skills learned on Udacity's Product Manager Nanodegree, and some inspiration from Mattias Adolfsson's course on Domestika, The Art of Sketching: Transform Your Doodles into Art.

## Getting started

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/almorcrette/mix-a-mood`

Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

Start the app with `npm run start`
(This will run esbuild to bundle JS source files, then run the app on node)

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:3030/`

## Alternate usage

You can bundle JS source files without launching the app using: `npm run build`

You can launch the app with automatic rebundling of source code using nodemon with `npm run dev-app`

## Running tests

Run unit tests with: `npm run unit:test`

Run end-to-end testing using Cypress with: `npm run e2e:test`

## About the app

The initial concept for mix-a-mood was to build _an app to take a moment to consider your mood, smile, become more aware, and go back to your day more grounded in yourself_

The concept draws on 'check-in' routines that are common in team-working environments, but which sometimes feel superficial, and don't allow team members to genuinely signal that they are anything but 'fine' or 'ok'. Perhaps an app where you are able to generate a humourous cartoon of your mood for yourself based on how you are feeling and share it with your colleagues could create a safer place to be honest, and contribute to greater trust and productivity.

## Design process

I drew on what I've learned about product design from Udacity's Product Manager nanodegree to develop the concept for the app, using the triple diamond design approach, as follows
